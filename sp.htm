<h1><b><i>INTRODUCTION</i></b></h1>
<b><i><p>"“A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you the less you know.”</p></i></b>
<b><i><p>– Diane Arbus</p></i></b>
<p><font size="+1">Sports Photography</b></i> refers to the genre of photography that covers all types of sports.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the majority of cases, professional sports photography is a branch of photojournalism, while amateur sports photography, such as photos of children playing association football, is a branch of vernacular photography.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The main application of professional sports photography is for editorial purposes; dedicated sports photographers usually work for newspapers, major wire agencies or dedicated sports magazines. However, sports photography is also used for advertising purposes both to build a brand and as well as to promote a sport in a way that cannot be accomplished by editorial means.</font></p>

<h1><b><i>INTRODUCTION</i></b></h1>
<b><i><p>“Photography is the art of making memories tangible.”</p></i></b>
<p><i><b>– Destin Sparks</b></i></p>
<p><i><b><font size="+1">Photography</b></i> is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.</font></p>

<h1><b><i>HISTORY</i></b></h1>
<p><i><b><font size="+1">The history of photography</b></i> began in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles: camera obscura image projection and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light. There are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th century. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that a breakthrough occurred. The world's earliest successful photograph was taken by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. As such, Niépce is considered the world's first photographer and the true inventor of photography as we know it today.</font></p>
